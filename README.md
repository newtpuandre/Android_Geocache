## How to build the app
* Setup the maps api key in the "google_maps_api.xml" file located in /res/values folder. The instructions there should be sufficient.

* Build the app and install it to your phone. (Either APK or debug 'run')

## How to use the app
* First create a user or login to an existing user
* All the features should now be available by using the hamburger menu by using the top left button

## Note
* The API is hosted on heroku and the first request might hang. Give it some time.
* You can also run the API locally by building the main.go file found in the repo main directory and changing the IP in the APIHandler.java file.
* If anything is unclear please dont hesitate to contact us.
